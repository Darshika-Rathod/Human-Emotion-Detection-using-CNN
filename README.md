# Human-Emotion-Detection-using-CNN
# Overview

This project focuses on detecting human emotions using deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained on facial expression data to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more.

# Features

Deep Learning-based Emotion Recognition

Real-time Face Detection and Emotion Classification

Optimized CNN Architecture for Improved Accuracy

Pre-trained Models Support (VGG16, ResNet, etc.)

# Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow/Keras

OpenCV

NumPy

Matplotlib

scikit-learn

# Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Human-Emotion-Detection.git
cd Human-Emotion-Detection

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Dataset

The model is trained on publicly available datasets like FER2013 or CK+.

Custom datasets can also be used with proper preprocessing.

# Usage

Training the Model:

python train.py --dataset path/to/dataset --epochs 50 --batch_size 32

Testing the Model:

python test.py --model model.h5 --image test.jpg

Real-time Emotion Detection:

python real_time_detection.py --model model.h5

# Performance Optimization

Data Augmentation: Enhances training performance and generalization.
